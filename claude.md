# Auth Integration Plan

## Objectives
- Understand the signup and login functionality in the frontend folder
- Understand the auth and JWT functionality in the backend folder  
- Integrate both to make LOGIN and SIGNUP work with both OAUTH and normal authentication
- Do not edit any other functionality, just integrate backend auth logic with frontend. If edits are required inform and then work after approval.

## Rules
- Use only mutually compatible dependencies.
- Implement what is needed in the most simple way, don't include unnecessary things.
- Do not implement without approval.
- Make sure that for testing, outputs and storage components are visible for approval.
- Work phase wise, only move to next when explicitly instructed to.

## Phase 1: Analysis
### Frontend Analysis (frontend\app\login, frontend\app\signup and other dependent files)
- [ ] Analyze signup page functionality
- [ ] Analyze login page functionality
- [ ] Check existing auth components and utilities
- [ ] Identify current auth flow and state management

### Backend Analysis
- [ ] Analyze auth endpoints and JWT implementation
- [ ] Check OAuth implementation
- [ ] Understand authentication middleware
- [ ] Document API contracts

## Phase 2: Integration Planning
- [ ] Design auth flow integration
- [ ] Plan API client implementation
- [ ] Design error handling strategy
- [ ] Plan testing approach

## Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Implement API client for auth
- [ ] Integrate normal login/signup
- [ ] Integrate OAuth flow
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Add loading states and feedback

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test normal signup/login flow
- [ ] Test OAuth flow
- [ ] Validate JWT handling
- [ ] Ensure proper error displays
